  <p>Hello, my name is Jose Miguel Romero and I go to Impact Academy in Hayward. I enjoy school a lot since that is where I spend a lot of my time with my friends.</p>
    <p>I also participate in the SMASH Berkely program during the summer.</p>
    <p>Somethings that I do during my free time are play video games, read, play more video games, and listen to music.</p>
    <p>I can also play instruments. The instruments that I can play are the violin, guitar, and the piano.</p>

    <p> Something that I am interested in studying is Software Engineering.</p>
    <p> This is because I have always been interested in computers and and how things are made</p>
    <p> Some of my favorite video games are Persona 5, Xenoblade Chronicles 1 and 2, and Super Smash Bros.</p>
